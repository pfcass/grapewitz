      <p>Welcome to Grapewitz, a place you can go after a couple of glasses of wine to
        discuss your purchase with friends, keep track of how much you haven't spent
        on wine by buying at a discount (savings you'll need for that nice, new liver),
        and generally having a merry old time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main panel shows the wines that have been bought by our friends.
